# Mechanic and Truck Tire Shop Demo

This repo contains a simple web page for decoding truck VINs using the free [NHTSA VIN Decoder API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/). It also lets you keep a list of parts installed on each VIN using your browser's local storage.

## Running

No server is required. Open `index.html` in a web browser. Enter a VIN and press **Decode VIN** to see the truck information. You can then add parts and the site will remember them for next time.
